      <div class="h1"><h1>JavaScript Weekly Notes</h1></div>
      <p>
        Time to learn some new concepts and components. These will be explored in greater detail over the coming weeks.
        For now we just have to write a sentence in our words explaining what the terms means
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><blockquote><p>Computed Properties and Watchers</p></strong>
      </p>
      <p>Allows you to track data in real time, great for to do lists and shopping lists. My guess is used for shopping carts functionality add or remove from order</p>
      <p>
        <br>
        <strong><p>Class and Style Bindings</p></strong>
      </p>
      <p>Allows you to add functional properties to your items providing a more interactive experience for users</p>
      <p>Enables sites to be built in a a way they can easily update classes - arrays can be used in a similar way to keep things simpler</p>
      <p>
        <br>
        <strong><p>Conditional Rendering</p></strong>
      </p>
      <p>Similar to inline styles adds the pretty to your app/site</p>
      <br>
      <strong><p>List Rendering</p></strong>
    </p>
    <p>Create a list with Id and class and values for objects themselves greater detail in a very similar way to HTML or even Python structure</p>
    
    <br>
    <strong><p>Event Handling </p></strong>
  </p>
  <p>This is a great way to effectively use data by retrieveing user input</p>
  <br>
  <strong><p>Component Basics </p></strong>
</p>
<p>Ahh back to more simple techniques to bring the pretty to your app and make it more of a enjoyable experience for the User. Adding features like counters and returning input from the user adding to a the level of interactivity (brining your app to life).</p>
  
    <br>
    <strong><p>Component Registration </p></strong>
  </p>
  <p>Following on from Component Basics, you then use 'Component Registration' to you set this up in your code using CamelCase (PascalCase). Using two arguments on your component one as a string the second is the object.</p>
     <p>This also refers to Global registration, so will most likely be more prominant in bigger scale sites not small business or personal sites/apps</p>

     <br>
     <strong><p>Props</p></strong>
   </p>
   <p>Think of this as subject headers or even better table headers, utilised to retrieve captured data in groups</p>
 
   <br>
   <strong><p>Events</p></strong>
 </p>
 <p>Same as HTML this functionality allows you to submit a form, rollover, onClick etc</p>
 <br>
 <strong><p>Slots</p></strong>
</p>
<p>I think this could be explained better on the site, I think it might be a method to provide a shortened URL or internal link. Little bit confused by this one.</p>

<br>
<strong><p>Dynamic & Async components | Keep-alive</p></strong>
</p>
<p>Internal tabs on your page, how cool is this, this could be greatly used on recipe sites, blog long boring story on tab one, ingredients tab, recipe tab, extras to compliment meal, this would be much better than scrolling and scrolling when the site doesnt have the 'click to recipe' option or you miss it</p>

<br>
<strong><p>Handling Edge Cases | Controlling Updates</p></strong>
</p>
<p>This is more an restricted admin function to introduce updates at controlled time, patches, releases at specified time to reduce user disruption</p>

<div class="h2"><h2>Extra tasks for the week</h2></div>
<p>Had one on one for assistance with implementation of site, what was required. Also joined the help up for further assignment clarification</p>
<p>Next week debugggggggging</p>
